I find it interesting that although there is emphasis on how good of a “coder” someone is, many of the concepts most important for a good programmer or software engineer deal with specific thought processes. For example, you can be the fastest to write code for a problem but still be a less effective way in comparison to a code that is easier to implement while also being less complex. This article is helpful in distinguishing the difference between a more vs less successful programmer and mentioning key concepts that can be more useful than knowing different methods/functions/languages, etc.
